<h2>Purpose of the program</h2>
<p>KillProcess is a small but powerful Windows utility designed to allow users to view all currently running processes (including applications and services), inspect their details, and terminate - or "kill" - selected processes. It serves as an alternative or supplement to the built-in Windows Task Manager, especially useful when certain processes are unresponsive, frozen, or protected. With KillProcess you get more control over process management, including batch termination and automatic scanning.</p>

<h2>Main features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Process enumeration:</strong> lists all running processes with name, PID, bitness (32/64-bit), owner, path.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed process information:</strong> for each process you can view version info, loaded modules, file data, memory usage, creation time, module list, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Terminate process:</strong> kill any selected process - individually or multiple at once - with a click. Supports both gentle close and forced termination.</li>
  <li><strong>Batch / automatic kill ("Scan and Kill"):</strong> you can configure KillProcess to periodically scan for and automatically terminate specified processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Context-menu integration & extra info:</strong> Right-clicking a process allows you to search the internet or query a database (e.g. via FileInspect.com) to get additional info about the process - useful for verifying unknown processes or spotting malware.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimize to system tray / run in background:</strong> Useful for leaving KillProcess running while you work; it doesn't require heavy resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique aspects</h2>
<p>Unlike the default Windows Task Manager, KillProcess provides a richer set of information per process (modules, file info, memory stats), the ability to kill multiple processes at once, and automation of process termination via scan-and-kill lists. The ability to quickly check unknown processes via web search or online database integration gives it utility as a rudimentary security / cleanup tool - for instance, when trying to remove malware that relaunches itself repeatedly.</p>

<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>KillProcess is aimed at advanced users, system administrators, technicians, or power users who need more control over processes than Windows Task Manager offers; users of older or resource-limited PCs; people troubleshooting unresponsive applications; and anyone needing to quickly kill multiple processes - including potentially malicious or runaway processes.</p>

<h2>Advantages of using KillProcess</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Free and lightweight, with small installer (~2–3 MB) and low resource usage.</li>
  <li>Detailed information per process - helps understand what each process does before terminating.</li>
  <li>Batch and automatic termination - ideal for cleanup, debugging, or malware removal.</li>
  <li>Simple, easy-to-use interface - suitable for both novice and advanced users.</li>
  <li>Can terminate even protected or stubborn processes - more aggressive than Task Manager.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional modules / Capabilities</h2>
<p>KillProcess offers the following functional capabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Process listing and enumeration (name, PID, bitness, owner, path)</li>
  <li>Detailed process data view (memory usage, loaded modules, version, file info)</li>
  <li>Single and multiple process termination (normal or forced)</li>
  <li>Automatic periodic scanning and termination according to user-defined lists ("Scan and Kill")</li>
  <li>Context-menu integration for quick web / database lookup of a process (for verification)</li>
  <li>Minimize to system tray, background run, lightweight footprint</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical requirements & supported platforms</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Supported Windows operating systems: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10; 32-bit and 64-bit.</li>
  <li>Installer size: approximately 2–3 MB.</li>
  <li>License: Freeware - free to use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use cases / Typical scenarios</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Terminate unresponsive or frozen applications when Task Manager fails.</li>
  <li>Clean up background or suspicious processes (e.g. malware) by identifying unknown processes and killing them - possibly repeatedly using "Scan and Kill".</li>
  <li>Free up system resources by killing unnecessary background tasks on older or low-resource PCs.</li>
  <li>Batch termination of multiple programs (e.g. before installing heavy software, or cleaning up after testing multiple apps).</li>
  <li>System administration - quickly stop services/processes that interfere with system maintenance or configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations and warnings</h2>
<p>Because KillProcess can forcibly terminate even protected or critical system processes, misuse can lead to system instability, forced reboots, or data loss. The tool warns users when critical processes are selected, but caution is strongly advised.</p>
<p>There is no built-in undo for killed processes and no guarantee unsaved data in terminated applications will be preserved. Batch or automated killing of processes should be configured carefully. Also - as with many powerful tools - users need a certain level of technical understanding to avoid mistakes.</p>

<h2>Installation & usage instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download the installer (e.g. KillProcess_Setup.exe) from a trusted site.</li>
  <li>Run the installer and install KillProcess.</li>
  <li>Launch KillProcess - the program will list all currently running processes automatically.</li>
  <li>Select one or more processes from the list; optionally inspect detailed info to verify what each process is.</li>
  <li>Click the "Kill Process" button (or use context menu) to terminate the selected processes - either normally or forced. Confirm if warning appears.</li>
  <li>Optionally configure a "Scan and Kill" list to automatically terminate certain processes at intervals.</li>
  <li>To minimize resource usage, you can minimize KillProcess to system tray and leave it running in background.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Security and safety</h2>
<p>KillProcess doesn't appear to contain malware or trojans - on reputable download sources it is marked as clean.</p>
<p>However, because it can forcibly terminate almost any process - including critical system processes - users must exercise caution to avoid system instability or data loss. The built-in warnings help mitigate risks but careful process selection is essential.</p>

<h2>Why choose KillProcess</h2>
<p>If you need a powerful, free, and lightweight tool to manage or terminate Windows processes - especially beyond what the standard Task Manager offers - KillProcess provides an effective solution. Its detailed process info, batch/automated termination, and small footprint make it valuable for system maintenance, troubleshooting, or security cleanup. For both regular users and system administrators, KillProcess can significantly simplify process management and give more control over running applications and services.</p>
